# Ninja-Bot
A voice controlled rover that operates on jutsu commands

## Inspiration
The theme of the hackathon being related to cartoons and animes helped us to think of several project ideas. Naruto, which is a very well-known manga and anime, was the major inspiration behind building this particular project. Naruto is a very memorable anime series from our childhood, and working on the Ninja Bot project has resurfaced a sense of nostalgia as we visited several aspects of the anime over again.

## What it does
Ninja Bot is basically a voice command following a 4WD rover that works on jutsu commands from the Naruto series and the rover also avoids obstacles.

## What's next for Ninja Bot
We would like to incorporate more actions through voice-command in Ninja Bot in the future. We would also like to explore a different way to send the voice signals through further experimentation. Ninja Bot has several other potentials that can be worked on in future.
